    to find the PID of libre office i ran the command "ps aux | grep libreoffice | awk '{print $2}'"
    
    Firstly, "ps aux" is used to obtain information about all processes running on the computer.
    Piping the command with "grep libreoffice" allowed ps to limit itself to processes with containing the word "libreoffice" in it
    And finally piping that with "awk '{print $2}'" takes only the second column from the output from the previous commands, this second column being the PID.

    then I can simply run the "kill" command on the PID to kill process
